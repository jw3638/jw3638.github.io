Here's the tidyvderse.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's a dataframe.
```{r}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x =rnorm(100, mean =1, sd=2),
    y= 1+2*x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

```{r}
plot_df |>
  ggplot (aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point()

```

Here's a plot. This seems to show
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$
